# Reference data

This directory contains auxiliary data files for testing.

The files starting with `as-` correspond to results from Reference # 1 (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972)

The `.txt` files are tables for visual inspection of results whereas .cmp files are for automatic "unit testing".

The `.py` files can be used to re-generate all tables (using SciPy).
