# Russell Stat - Statistics calculations, probability distributions, and pseudo random numbers

_This crate is part of [Russell - Rust Scientific Library](https://github.com/cpmech/russell)_

This repository contains structures and functions to work with statistics and probability distributions. Internally, we wrap and use the [rand_distr](https://docs.rs/rand_distr/latest/rand_distr/) crate for generating samples.

Documentation:

- [API reference (docs.rs)](https://docs.rs/russell_stat)

## Installation

Add this to your Cargo.toml (choose the right version):

```toml
[dependencies]
russell_stat = "*"
```

## Examples

```rust
use russell_stat::{statistics, DistributionFrechet, Histogram, ProbabilityDistribution, StrError};


fn main() -> Result<(), StrError> {
    // generate samples
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let dist = DistributionFrechet::new(0.0, 1.0, 1.0)?;
    let nsamples = 10_000;
    let mut data = vec![0.0; nsamples];
    for i in 0..nsamples {
        data[i] = dist.sample(&mut rng);
    }
    println!("{}", statistics(&data));

    // text-plot
    let stations = (0..20).map(|i| (i as f64) * 0.5).collect::<Vec<f64>>();
    let mut hist = Histogram::new(&stations)?;
    hist.count(&data);
    println!("{}", hist);
    Ok(())
}
```
