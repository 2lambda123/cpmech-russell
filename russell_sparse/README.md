## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

This crate implements tools for handling sparse matrices and functions to solve large sparse systems using the best libraries out there, such as [UMFPACK (recommended)](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) and [MUMPS (for very large systems)](https://mumps-solver.org).

We have three storage formats for sparse matrices:

* COO: COOrdinates matrix, also known as a sparse triplet.
* CSC: Compressed Sparse Column matrix
* CSR: Compressed Sparse Row matrix

Additionally, to unify the handling of the above sparse matrix data structures, we have:

* SparseMatrix: Either a COO, CSC, or CSR matrix

The COO matrix is the best when we need to update the values of the matrix because it has easy access to the triples (i, j, aij). For instance, the repetitive access is the primary use case for codes based on the finite element method (FEM) for approximating partial differential equations. Moreover, the COO matrix allows storing duplicate entries; for example, the triple `(0, 0, 123.0)` can be stored as two triples `(0, 0, 100.0)` and `(0, 0, 23.0)`. Again, this is the primary need for FEM codes because of the so-called assembly process where elements add to the same positions in the "global stiffness" matrix. Nonetheless, the duplicate entries must be summed up at some stage for the linear solver (e.g., MUMPS, UMFPACK). These linear solvers also use the more memory-efficient storage formats CSC and CSR. See the [russell_sparse documentation](https://docs.rs/russell_sparse) for further information.

This library also provides functions to read and write Matrix Market files containing (huge) sparse matrices that can be used in performance benchmarking or other studies. The [read_matrix_market()] function reads a Matrix Market file and returns a [CooMatrix]. To write a Matrix Market file, we can use the function [write_matrix_market()], which takes a [SparseMatrix] and, thus, automatically convert COO to CSC or COO to CSR, also performing the sum of duplicates. The `write_matrix_market` also writes an SMAT file (almost like the Matrix Market format) without the header and with zero-based indices. The SMAT file can be given to the fantastic [Vismatrix](https://github.com/cpmech/vismatrix) tool to visualize the sparse matrix structure and values interactively; see the example below.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

This crate depends on `russell_lab`, which, in turn, depends on an efficient BLAS library such as [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS) and [Intel MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2023-2/overview.html). This crate also depends on [UMFPACK](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) and [MUMPS](https://mumps-solver.org).

[The root README file presents the steps to install the required dependencies.](https://github.com/cpmech/russell)

## <a name="cargo"></a> Setting Cargo.toml

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/russell_sparse.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/russell_sparse)

üëÜ Check the crate version and update your Cargo.toml accordingly:

```toml
[dependencies]
russell_sparse = "*"
```

Or, considering the optional _features_ ([see more about these here](https://github.com/cpmech/russell)):

```toml
[dependencies]
russell_sparse = { version = "*", features = ["local_libs", "intel_mkl"] }
```

## <a name="examples"></a> Examples

See also:

* [russell_sparse/examples](https://github.com/cpmech/russell/tree/main/russell_sparse/examples)

**Note:** For the functions dealing with complex numbers, the following line must be added to all derived code:

```rust
use num_complex::Complex64;
```

This line will bring `Complex64` to the scope. For convenience the (russell_lab) macro `cpx!` may be used to allocate complex numbers.

### Solve a tiny sparse linear system using UMFPACK

```rust
use russell_lab::{vec_approx_eq, Vector};
use russell_sparse::prelude::*;
use russell_sparse::StrError;

fn main() -> Result<(), StrError> {
    // constants
    let ndim = 3; // number of rows = number of columns
    let nnz = 5; // number of non-zero values

    // allocate solver
    let mut umfpack = SolverUMFPACK::new()?;

    // allocate the coefficient matrix
    let mut coo = SparseMatrix::new_coo(ndim, ndim, nnz, Sym::No)?;
    coo.put(0, 0, 0.2)?;
    coo.put(0, 1, 0.2)?;
    coo.put(1, 0, 0.5)?;
    coo.put(1, 1, -0.25)?;
    coo.put(2, 2, 0.25)?;

    // print matrix
    let a = coo.as_dense();
    let correct = "‚îå                   ‚îê\n\
                   ‚îÇ   0.2   0.2     0 ‚îÇ\n\
                   ‚îÇ   0.5 -0.25     0 ‚îÇ\n\
                   ‚îÇ     0     0  0.25 ‚îÇ\n\
                   ‚îî                   ‚îò";
    assert_eq!(format!("{}", a), correct);

    // call factorize
    umfpack.factorize(&mut coo, None)?;

    // allocate two right-hand side vectors
    let b = Vector::from(&[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]);

    // calculate the solution
    let mut x = Vector::new(ndim);
    umfpack.solve(&mut x, &coo, &b, false)?;
    let correct = vec![3.0, 2.0, 4.0];
    vec_approx_eq(x.as_data(), &correct, 1e-14);
    Ok(())
}
```

## <a name="tools"></a> Tools

This crate includes a tool named `solve_matrix_market` to study the performance of the available sparse solvers (currently MUMPS and UMFPACK).

`solve_matrix_market` reads a [Matrix Market file](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html) and solves the linear system:

```text
A ‚ãÖ x = b
```

where the right-hand side (b) is a vector containing only ones.

The data directory contains an example of a Matrix Market file named `bfwb62.mtx`, and you may download more matrices from https://sparse.tamu.edu/

For example, run the command:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin solve_matrix_market -- ~/Downloads/matrix-market/bfwb62.mtx
```

Or

```bash
cargo run --release --bin solve_matrix_market -- --help
```

to see the options.

The default solver of `solve_matrix_market` is UMFPACK. To run with MUMPS, use the `--genie` (-g) flag:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin solve_matrix_market -- -g mumps ~/Downloads/matrix-market/bfwb62.mtx
```

The output looks like this:

## <a name="issues"></a> MUMPS + OpenBLAS issue

We found that MUMPS + OpenBLAS becomes very, very slow when the number of OpenMP threads is left automatic, i.e., using the available number of threads. Thus, with OpenBLAS, it is recommended to set LinSolParams.mumps_num_threads = 1 (this is automatically set when using OpenBLAS).

This issue has also been discovered by [1](#ref1), who states (page 72) _"We have observed that multi-threading of OpenBLAS library in MUMPS leads to multiple thread conflicts which sometimes result in significant slow-down of the solver."_

Therefore, we have to take one of the two approaches:

* If fixing the number of OpenMP threads for MUMPS, set the number of OpenMP threads for OpenBLAS to 1
* If fixing the number of OpenMP threads for OpenBLAS, set the number of OpenMP threads for MUMPS to 1 

This issue has **not** been noticed with MUMPS + Intel MKL.

Command to reproduce the issue:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=20 ~/rust_modules/release/solve_matrix_market -g mumps ~/Downloads/matrix-market/inline_1.mtx -m 0 -v --override-prevent-issue
```

Also, to reproduce the issue, we need:

* Git hash = e020d9c8486502bd898d93a1998a0cf23c4d5057
* Remove Debian OpenBLAS, MUMPS, and etc.
* Install the compiled MUMPS solver with `02-ubuntu-openblas-compile.bash`

## <a name="developers"></a> For developers

* The `c_code` directory contains a thin wrapper to the sparse solvers (MUMPS, UMFPACK)
* The `build.rs` file uses the crate `cc` to build the C-wrappers
* The `zscripts` directory also contains following:
    * `memcheck.bash`: Checks for memory leaks on the C-code using Valgrind
    * `run-examples`: Runs all examples in the `examples` directory
    * `run-solve-matrix-market.bash`: Runs the solve-matrix-market tool from the `bin` directory
