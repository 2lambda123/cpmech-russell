## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

This repository implements the `russell_sparse` crate which contains tools for handling sparse matrices and functions to solve large sparse systems using the best libraries out there, such as [UMFPACK (recommended)](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse) and [MUMPS (for very large systems)](https://mumps-solver.org). Optionally, you may want to use the [Intel DSS solver](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2023-2/direct-sparse-solver-dss-interface-routines.html).

We have three storage formats for sparse matrices:

* COO: COOrdinates matrix, also known as a sparse triplet.
* CSC: Compressed Sparse Column matrix
* CSR: Compressed Sparse Row matrix

Additionally, to unify the handling of the above sparse matrix data structures, we have:

* SparseMatrix: Either a COO, CSC, or CSR matrix

The COO matrix is the best when we need to update the values of the matrix because it has easy access to the triples (i, j, aij). For instance, the repetitive access is the primary use case for codes based on the finite element method (FEM) for approximating partial differential equations. Moreover, the COO matrix allows storing duplicate entries; for example, the triple `(0, 0, 123.0)` can be stored as two triples `(0, 0, 100.0)` and `(0, 0, 23.0)`. Again, this is the primary need for FEM codes because of the so-called assembly process where elements add to the same positions in the "global stiffness" matrix. Nonetheless, the duplicate entries must be summed up at some stage for the linear solver (e.g., MUMPS, UMFPACK, and Intel DSS). These linear solvers also use the more memory-efficient storage formats CSC and CSR. See the [russell_sparse documentation](https://docs.rs/russell_sparse) for further information.

This library also provides functions to read and write Matrix Market files containing (huge) sparse matrices that can be used in performance benchmarking or other studies. The [read_matrix_market()] function reads a Matrix Market file and returns a [CooMatrix]. To write a Matrix Market file, we can use the function [write_matrix_market()], which takes a [SparseMatrix] and, thus, automatically convert COO to CSC or COO to CSR, also performing the sum of duplicates. The `write_matrix_market` also writes an SMAT file (almost like the Matrix Market format) without the header and with zero-based indices. The SMAT file can be given to the fantastic [Vismatrix](https://github.com/cpmech/vismatrix) tool to visualize the sparse matrix structure and values interactively; see the example below.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation on Debian/Ubuntu/Linux

`russell_sparse` depends on `russell_lab`, which, in turn, depends on an efficient BLAS library such as [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS) and [Intel MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2023-2/overview.html). `russell_sparse` depends also on [UMFPACK](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse), [MUMPS](https://mumps-solver.org), and, optionally, on [Intel DSS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-reference-c/2023-2/direct-sparse-solver-dss-interface-routines.html). Moreover, some default Debian packages lack new features and may lead to slower computations. Therefore, we have three options:

1. Use the standard Debian packages based on OpenBLAS (default)
2. Compile MUMPS and UMFPACK with OpenBLAS
3. Compile MUMPS and UMFPACK with Intel MKL and enable Intel DSS

Options 2 and 3 require the following environment variables:

```bash
export RUSSELL_SPARSE_USE_LOCAL_MUMPS=1
export RUSSELL_SPARSE_USE_LOCAL_UMFPACK=1
```

Option 3 also requires the following environment variables:

```bash
export RUSSELL_LAB_USE_INTEL_MKL=1
export RUSSELL_SPARSE_WITH_INTEL_DSS=1
```

For convenience, you may use the scripts in the [zscripts](https://github.com/cpmech/russell/tree/main/russell_sparse/zscripts) directory.

**1.** Use the standard Debian packages based on OpenBLAS:

```bash
bash zscripts/01-ubuntu-openblas-debian.bash
```

**2. (xor)** compile MUMPS and UMFPACK with OpenBLAS:

```bash
bash zscripts/02-ubuntu-openblas-compile.bash
```

**3. (xor)** compile MUMPS and UMFPACK with Intel MKL:

```bash
bash zscripts/03-ubuntu-intel-mkl-compile.bash
```

**Important:** To use the locally compiled UMFPACK you must remove `libsuitesparse-dev`.

The compiled MUMPS files will be installed in `/usr/local/include/mumps` and `/usr/local/lib/mumps`.

The compiled UMFPACK files will be installed in `/usr/local/include/umfpack` and `/usr/local/lib/umfpack`.

### Number of threads

By default, OpenBLAS will use all available threads, including Hyper-Threads that may worsen the performance. Thus, it is best to set the following environment variable:

```bash
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=<real-core-number>
```

Substitute `<real-core-number>` with the correct value from your system.

Furthermore, if working on a multi-threaded application where the solver should not be multi-threaded on its own (e.g., running parallel calculations such as in optimization via genetic algorithms or differential evolution), you may set:

```bash
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
```

### Solve a tiny sparse linear system using UMFPACK

```rust
use russell_lab::{vec_approx_eq, Vector};
use russell_sparse::prelude::*;
use russell_sparse::StrError;

fn main() -> Result<(), StrError> {
    // constants
    let ndim = 3; // number of rows = number of columns
    let nnz = 5; // number of non-zero values

    // allocate solver
    let mut umfpack = SolverUMFPACK::new()?;

    // allocate the coefficient matrix
    let mut coo = SparseMatrix::new_coo(ndim, ndim, nnz, None, false)?;
    coo.put(0, 0, 0.2)?;
    coo.put(0, 1, 0.2)?;
    coo.put(1, 0, 0.5)?;
    coo.put(1, 1, -0.25)?;
    coo.put(2, 2, 0.25)?;

    // print matrix
    let a = coo.as_dense();
    let correct = "‚îå                   ‚îê\n\
                   ‚îÇ   0.2   0.2     0 ‚îÇ\n\
                   ‚îÇ   0.5 -0.25     0 ‚îÇ\n\
                   ‚îÇ     0     0  0.25 ‚îÇ\n\
                   ‚îî                   ‚îò";
    assert_eq!(format!("{}", a), correct);

    // call factorize
    umfpack.factorize(&mut coo, None)?;

    // allocate two right-hand side vectors
    let b = Vector::from(&[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]);

    // calculate the solution
    let mut x = Vector::new(ndim);
    umfpack.solve(&mut x, &coo, &b, false)?;
    let correct = vec![3.0, 2.0, 4.0];
    vec_approx_eq(x.as_data(), &correct, 1e-14);
    Ok(())
}
```

## <a name="tools"></a> Tools

This crate includes a tool named `solve_matrix_market` to study the performance of the available sparse solvers (currently MUMPS and UMFPACK).

`solve_matrix_market` reads a [Matrix Market file](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html) and solves the linear system:

```text
A ‚ãÖ x = b
```

where the right-hand side (b) is a vector containing only ones.

The data directory contains an example of a Matrix Market file named `bfwb62.mtx`, and you may download more matrices from https://sparse.tamu.edu/

For example, run the command:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin solve_matrix_market -- ~/Downloads/matrix-market/bfwb62.mtx
```

Or

```bash
cargo run --release --bin solve_matrix_market -- --help
```

to see the options.

The default solver of `solve_matrix_market` is UMFPACK. To run with MUMPS, use the `--genie` (-g) flag:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin solve_matrix_market -- -g mumps -x -y ~/Downloads/matrix-market/bfwb62.mtx
```

The output looks like this:
